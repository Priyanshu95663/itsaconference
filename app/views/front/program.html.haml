        %p In this training, you will get to see several examples of scary Ruby code. The samples will be inspired by code I have actually seen in the wild. As a team, we will Rubyify the code, examine exactly what that means and why it is an improvement, and then land on some guidelines we can use to keep our code from scaring our mom.
